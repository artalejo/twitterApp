# tweetapp
Android app using Twitter sdk following clean architecture.
It shows the user profile on click of any tweet as well as saving favorite tweets on database, allowing the user checking their favorite tweets offline.

I have followed the clean architecture structure explained in the following link : "https://github.com/dmilicic/Android-Clean-Boilerplate" with minor changes.
